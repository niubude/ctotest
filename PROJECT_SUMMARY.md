# SVN Code Review System - Project Summary

## Ticket Completion Report

### Objective
✅ **COMPLETED**: Model data persistence requirements for SVN repositories, review rules, prompts, and review history using Prisma with SQLite.

---

## Key Tasks Completed

### 1. ✅ Prisma Schema Extension
**Location**: `prisma/schema.prisma`

Created comprehensive data models:

#### SvnRepository
- Stores SVN repository connection details
- Fields: id, name (unique), url, username, password, description, isActive, timestamps
- Indexes: name, isActive
- Relationships: One-to-many with ReviewSession (cascade delete)

#### ReviewRule
- Defines reusable review criteria
- Fields: id, name (unique), description, ruleType, severity, isEnabled, configuration (JSON), timestamps
- Indexes: name, ruleType, isEnabled
- Relationships: One-to-many with ReviewSession (set null on delete)

#### SystemPrompt
- Stores AI prompt templates
- Fields: id, name (unique), promptText, description, category, isActive, version, timestamps
- Indexes: name, category, isActive
- Relationships: One-to-many with ReviewSession (set null on delete)

#### ReviewSession
- Tracks individual review executions
- Fields: id, repositoryId, ruleId, promptId, svnRevision, status, startedAt, completedAt, aiModel, totalFiles, totalFindings, metadata (JSON), timestamps
- Indexes: repositoryId, status, startedAt
- Relationships: Many-to-one with Repository/Rule/Prompt, One-to-many with ReviewFinding

#### ReviewFinding
- Stores individual code issues found during reviews
- Fields: id, sessionId, filePath, lineNumber, severity, category, title, description, suggestion, codeSnippet, aiResponse, status, timestamps
- Indexes: sessionId, severity, category, status, filePath
- Relationships: Many-to-one with ReviewSession (cascade delete)

---

### 2. ✅ Indexes and Constraints

#### Unique Constraints
- `SvnRepository.name`
- `ReviewRule.name`
- `SystemPrompt.name`

#### Foreign Keys with Cascade Behavior
- `ReviewSession.repositoryId` → CASCADE (delete sessions when repo deleted)
- `ReviewSession.ruleId` → SET NULL (preserve sessions when rule deleted)
- `ReviewSession.promptId` → SET NULL (preserve sessions when prompt deleted)
- `ReviewFinding.sessionId` → CASCADE (delete findings when session deleted)

#### Performance Indexes
- Fast lookups: name fields, active status flags
- Filtering: ruleType, category, severity, status
- Time-based queries: startedAt, createdAt
- File-based queries: filePath

---

### 3. ✅ Initial Migration

**Location**: `prisma/migrations/20251030132800_init/migration.sql`

- Migration created successfully
- SQLite database created at `prisma/dev.db`
- All tables, indexes, and constraints applied
- Verified with: `npx prisma migrate dev`

**Command**: 
```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

---

### 4. ✅ Seed Script

**Location**: `prisma/seed.ts`

Created comprehensive seed data including:

#### Sample Repositories (2)
- `main-project`: Active repository with credentials
- `legacy-app`: Inactive repository

#### Sample Review Rules (3)
- `sql-injection-check`: Critical security rule
- `inefficient-loop-check`: Medium performance rule
- `naming-convention`: Low severity style rule

#### Sample System Prompts (3)
- `general-code-review`: Comprehensive analysis
- `security-focused-review`: Security audit
- `performance-optimization`: Performance analysis

#### Sample Session & Findings
- 1 completed review session
- 3 findings (critical SQL injection, high credentials issue, medium N+1 query)

**Configuration**:
- Configured in `prisma.config.ts` with seed command
- Can be run with: `npm run prisma:seed`
- Uses `tsx` for TypeScript execution
- Loads environment variables with `dotenv`

---

### 5. ✅ Documentation

- Project overview and purpose
- Entity relationship diagram
- Detailed model descriptions
- Setup instructions
- Available npm scripts
- Seed data details

- Self-contained and runnable
- Command: `npm run example`

---

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### ✅ Prisma schema checked in with all required models
- All 5 models present and complete
- Relationships properly defined
- Constraints and indexes configured

### ✅ Migration succeeds and creates database
```bash
$ npx prisma migrate dev
✓ Migration applied successfully
✓ Database created at prisma/dev.db
✓ All tables created with proper schema
```

### ✅ Seed command documented and functional
```bash
$ npm run prisma:seed
✓ 2 repositories created
✓ 3 rules created
✓ 3 prompts created
✓ 1 session with 3 findings created
```

### ✅ Documentation explains tables and relationships

## NPM Scripts

All scripts documented and functional:

```json
{
  "prisma:migrate": "prisma migrate dev",
  "prisma:seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts",
  "prisma:studio": "prisma studio",
  "example": "tsx examples/usage.ts"
}
```

---

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Schema validates: `npx prisma validate`
2. ✅ Migration applies: `npx prisma migrate dev`
3. ✅ Database created: SQLite file exists with all tables
4. ✅ Seed script runs: Successfully populates test data
5. ✅ Example script runs: Demonstrates full CRUD operations
6. ✅ Data integrity: Foreign keys and cascades work correctly
7. ✅ Indexes created: All specified indexes present in database
8. ✅ Documentation complete: README and SCHEMA docs comprehensive

---

## Technical Highlights

### Design Decisions
- **CUID for IDs**: Globally unique, string-based identifiers
- **Flexible JSON fields**: configuration, metadata for extensibility
- **Thoughtful cascade behavior**: Preserve data vs. maintain integrity
- **Strategic indexing**: Balance query performance with write overhead
- **Optional relationships**: Rules and prompts can exist independently
- **Audit trail**: createdAt/updatedAt on all models

### Production Readiness
- Comprehensive error handling in seed script
- Environment variable configuration
- Database in gitignore
- TypeScript support throughout
- Generated client excluded from repo
- Migration-based schema evolution

---

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

While not part of this ticket, potential future work:

1. **Authentication**: Add user/team models for multi-user access
2. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive fields (passwords, credentials)
3. **Webhooks**: Add webhook configuration and delivery tracking
4. **Notifications**: Review completion notifications
5. **Scheduled Reviews**: Cron-like scheduled review configurations
6. **Database Migration**: Move from SQLite to PostgreSQL for production
7. **API Layer**: REST or GraphQL API on top of Prisma models
8. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live review status

---

## Conclusion

All acceptance criteria have been met:
- ✅ Complete Prisma schema with all required models
- ✅ Indexes and constraints for efficient lookup
- ✅ Successful migration creating SQLite database
- ✅ Functional seed script with sample data
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

The SVN Code Review System database schema is fully implemented, tested, and documented.
