# SVN Commit UI - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the SVN Commit Viewer application as per the ticket requirements.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Repository Management Section
- **RepositorySelector Component**: Dropdown component allowing users to select from available SVN repositories
- **Database Integration**: Repositories are stored in SQLite via Prisma and fetched through the `/api/svn/repositories` endpoint
- **Auto-selection**: First repository is automatically selected on page load
- **Visual Feedback**: Repository descriptions shown in dropdown, disabled state during loading

### ✅ Commit List View
- **Table Display**: Commit list displayed in a responsive table with columns for:
  - Checkbox for selection
  - Revision number
  - Author
  - Date (formatted)
  - Commit message
  - Number of changed files
- **Filtering**: Two input fields for filtering:
  - Keyword search (searches in message and file paths)
  - Author filter
  - Apply Filters button + Enter key support
- **Empty/Loading States**: Proper UI states for loading and empty results

### ✅ Multi-Select Controls
- **Individual Selection**: Checkbox on each commit row
- **Select All**: Header checkbox to select/deselect all commits
- **Selection Persistence**: Selected commits persist across filter changes
- **Selection Summary**: Banner showing count of selected commits
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected rows highlighted with different background

### ✅ Commit Detail Panel
- **Sheet/Drawer Component**: Side drawer using shadcn Sheet component
- **Commit Information**: Displays revision, author, date, and full message
- **File Changes List**: Shows all changed file paths
- **Diff Viewer**: Integration with react-diff-viewer-continued
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Side-by-side or unified view
  - Change type badges (added/modified/deleted)
- **Loading/Error States**: Proper handling of API states

### ✅ Responsive Layout & Accessibility
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout using Tailwind CSS
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support throughout the application
- **Focus States**: Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
- **ARIA Labels**: Proper labels on checkboxes, buttons, and interactive elements
- **Screen Reader Support**: Hidden text for loading states and icons

### ✅ API Integration
- **Data Fetching**: SWR for efficient data fetching with automatic revalidation
- **API Endpoints Implemented**:
  - `GET /api/svn/repositories` - Fetch repositories from Prisma
  - `POST /api/svn/repositories` - Create new repository
  - `GET /api/svn/commits?repositoryId={id}&keyword={keyword}&author={author}` - Fetch filtered commits
  - `GET /api/svn/diff?repositoryId={id}&revision={revision}` - Fetch diff for specific commit
- **Mock Data**: Currently using mock SVN data (would connect to real SVN in production)

### ✅ Loading, Empty, and Error States
- **Loading States**: Spinner with accessible status role
- **Empty States**: User-friendly messages with icons when no data available
- **Error States**: Clear error messages with alert styling
- **Conditional Rendering**: Appropriate UI for each state

### ✅ Component Tests
- **CommitList Tests** (11 tests):
  - Rendering commit list correctly
  - Loading state display
  - Empty state display
  - Individual commit selection
  - Multiple commit selection
  - Commit row click handling
  - Keyword filter input
  - Author filter input
  - Filter submission via Enter key
  - Selection summary display
  - Selection persistence across filter changes
  
- **RepositorySelector Tests** (7 tests):
  - Rendering with label
  - Placeholder display
  - Selected repository display
  - Loading state
  - Repository selection handling
  - Repository name rendering
  - Empty list handling

**Test Results**: All 18 tests passing ✅

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui design system
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState) + SWR for server state
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite

### Component Structure
```
app/page.tsx (Main page - orchestrates all components)
├── RepositorySelector (Repository dropdown)
├── CommitList (Table with filtering and multi-select)
│   ├── Filter inputs (keyword, author)
│   ├── Selection summary
│   └── Commit rows with checkboxes
└── CommitDetail (Side drawer)
    ├── Commit metadata
    ├── File changes list
    └── Diff viewer for each file
```

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Multi-Select with Persistence**
   - Uses Set data structure for efficient lookup
   - State maintained at page level
   - Persists across filter changes
   - Visual feedback and count display

2. **Filter System**
   - Local state for input values
   - Server-side filtering via query parameters
   - Apply on button click or Enter key
   - Filters work on message content and file paths

3. **Diff Visualization**
   - react-diff-viewer-continued for syntax highlighting
   - Change type badges with color coding
   - Lazy loaded when drawer opens
   - Error handling for failed requests

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Breakpoints for tablet and desktop
   - Touch-friendly targets
   - Overflow handling for long content

## Accessibility Features
- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus visible states
- Screen reader text for icons
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Color contrast compliance

## Testing Strategy
- Component tests using React Testing Library
- User interaction testing with userEvent
- Mock data for consistent test results
- Accessibility considerations in tests
- Test coverage for critical user flows

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Real SVN integration (currently using mock data)
- Commit comparison between multiple selected commits
- Export functionality for selected commits
- Advanced search with date ranges
- User authentication and authorization
- Repository configuration management UI
- Commit graph visualization
- Dark mode support

## Setup Instructions
See README.md for detailed setup and usage instructions.

## Notes
- Mock data is used for commits and diffs since actual SVN integration would require SVN server access
- The application is production-ready from a frontend perspective
- Database is seeded with 3 sample repositories on initial setup
